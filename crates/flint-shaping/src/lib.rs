//! Wire-shaping primitives for opening-handshake evasion (ADR 0006 Phase 1, generalized).
//!
//! Two orthogonal, composable levers shape *only* the opening write (the TLS ClientHello) and then
//! pass through untouched for the rest of the connection:
//!
//! - [`SegmentShapingStream`] — **Layer C, `tcp_split`**: split the opening *byte stream* across TCP
//!   segments (optionally at the SNI boundary, with an inter-segment delay). The ClientHello stays a
//!   single TLS record; this defeats DPI that matches the SNI within one packet, but a censor that
//!   reassembles TCP sees the original record again.
//! - [`RecordFragmentingStream`] — **Layer B, `record_fragment`**: re-emit the ClientHello as
//!   *multiple TLS records*, each with its own `16 03 01 <len>` header. Because fragmentation lives in
//!   the record structure (above TCP), it survives censor TCP reassembly; it defeats DPI that inspects
//!   only the first record or doesn't reassemble a handshake message across records (RFC 8446 §5.1).
//!
//! Both read a single [`WirePlan`] (the genome carrying Layer B + Layer C). Compose them by stacking:
//! put record fragmentation **outermost** (closest to the TLS engine) over segment shaping, so the CH
//! is re-framed into records first and those bytes are then split across TCP segments —
//! `RecordFragmentingStream::new(SegmentShapingStream::new(socket, plan), plan)`. A default plan is a
//! no-op passthrough, so shaping is strictly opt-in.
//!
//! Extracted from spark's `core::transport::shaping`. Unlike that module, [`WirePlan`] here is
//! **config-agnostic** (no `from_config` over spark's `ShapingConfig`): a consumer constructs it
//! directly or maps its own config onto the public fields.
